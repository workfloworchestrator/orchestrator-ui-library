692 Adds WfoErrorMonitoringProvider for tracing purposes. It exposes 2 methods via the useWfoErrorMonitoring hook. These reporting functions are used within the component library. To start using it, the WfoErrorMonitoringProvider needs to be added to the _app.tsx and the errorMonitoringHandler needs to be implemented.
