1479 csvDownload (Breaking change): Changed the parameters of initiateCsvFileDownload for directly exporting data to CSV. GroupedTable: The table has a small header with a button "Collapse / Expand", this can now be overridden. Introduced a utility type to help ensuring that all the props of an object will be of type "string". Typically useful for the csvDownload functionality
