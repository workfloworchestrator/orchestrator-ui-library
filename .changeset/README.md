# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

# Usage in project

### Preparing the release

```bash
npm changeset
```

-   Selecting packages that will get a version bump and, in a later step, being published
-   Specifies per selected package the type of version bump (`major`, `minor` or `patch`)
-   Adds a description or release notes for the release
-   All entries will be saved in a `.md` file in the `.changeset` folder

### Processing changes

```bash
npm changeset version
```

-   Applies version bump in the selected packages
-   Removes the `.md` file from the `.changset` folder

### Publishing changes

```bash
npm changeset publish
```

-   Performs the actual publish to npm
-   This step also creates git tags, push them to git with `git push --follow-tags`

### The TLDR

```
npm changeset
npm changeset version
npm changeset publish
```
