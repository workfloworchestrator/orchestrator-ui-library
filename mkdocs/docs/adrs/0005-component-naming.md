# ADR 0005 - Turbo Repo and dependencies

Date: 2023-08-08

## Status

*Accepted*

## Decisions
To (practically) ensure components have unique names even when they are used in combination with components from other sources we have decided that all components that the @orchesrator-ui package exposes are prefixed with Wfo. All complete pages that are exposed are prefixed with WFO and post fixed with Page

## Action items
- Rename all exposed component in @orcestrator-ui packages

## Attendees
- Hans Trompert
- René Dohmen
- Ricardo van der Heijden
- Ruben van Leeuwen
